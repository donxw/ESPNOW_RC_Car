# ESPNOW_RC_Car
SMARS inspired RC Car using ESPNOW to transmit signals from the remote control unit.

## Credits
This project was inspired by the SMARS arduino car described at this website:  https://www.smarsfan.com/ 
Modifications were made to use and ESP based microcontroller to allow a simple remote control with minimal added hardware.  In addition, the wheels were redesigned to use an o-ring in place of the 3D printed tank treads.
